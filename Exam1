Statistics (informally) : The art and science of collectin, analuzing, presenting, and interpreting data
  Descriptive: Concerned with the grapical techniques for describing some characteristcs of the data
  Inferential: Make inferences about a data set based on information obtained from a sample. The information
    used to make these inferences is some type of descriptive statistic

Population: Largest set of subjects/elements that you want to make inferences about Ex: All citizens in Mass
Frame: List containin all embers of the population  
Variable: Some characteristic of the population that we want to measure Ex: Income, Age
Sample: A subset of the population of interest  
Statistic: Fact or characteristic about the sample Ex: Avg blood pressure
Statistical Inference: A statement about the population based on data collected in the sample

Ch2: Data

Do we have good measurements??
  1. Is the concept being studied adequately reflected by the measurements?
    -What should be measured
    -How should it be measured
  2. Is the data measured accurately
  3. Is there sufficient data (quality and quantity) to draw a reasonable conclusion

The upshot: BS in -> BS out 

Scientific Method:
  1. Get info about phenomenon being studied
  2. Formulate a hypothesis
  3. Collect data to test the hypothesis
  4. Does the data support your hypothesis? If so, then you have a sound conclusion; if not, re-evaluate

------------ i was copying word for word.... but lecture slides are online
  taking speific what he says notes not

placebo: a fake, mostly in pharmasudicals

nominal: name
ordinal: ranks (low / high) EX: Likert Scale
interval: tempurature, more specific that ordinal. Ex: 60* is more than just hotter than 30*
  *ZERO IS UNDEFINED*
Ratio: most specific INCLUDES ZERO

This scale isnt about how its coded, its about underlying data
  Ex: 0 for male 1 for female, 1 is not > 0

For interval, 0 has no big significance, it is undefined

only different between interval and ratio is that zero has a significant meaning
  Ex: $0 means no nomey, class size, age, mass

a) interval
b) ratio
c) ordinal
d) nominal
e) ratio

continuous quantitive variables can be on a range of values
age is discrete if it is measured at the most specific level
    continuous if generalizing

collecting data on religious affiliation isnt discrete or continuous 
  bc its qualitative not quantitative

-gender
-political affiliation
-opinion
-rate news

1. qual, nominal 
2. qual, nominal
3. qual, nominal
4. qual, ordinal

ASK AFTER CLASS WHY WEIGHT IS NOT DISCRETE AND IS CONTINUOUS

Bar Chart / Pie chart 
  They are for qualitative data
  Histogram is a bar chart for quantitative data

pie chart shows in terms of fractions of the whole

If numerical data has natural classifications, use those; otherwise, you gotta create your own

classifications
  -Figure out how many bars you want
  -Detwemine width of classifications (0-10, 0-15, 50-100)
    -Max value - smallest value / # classes
  -no empty intervals, each bar must have at least one observation

always round up
  in this ex, 8.33 -> 9

median is the 50th percentile

finding percentile - on slides. n = size of data set, p = percentile, l = location

10th percentile is 28
88th is 73

the value of 73 is such that 88% of the data is less than that

dont forget to round up IN an integer

percentile of observation

quartiles is a fancy name for 25th, 50th, 75th percentiles

Q2= median

These 5 numbers can craete a box and whisker plot
X smallest, X largest, Q1, Q2, Q3

kinda looks like this
x smallest *---------|______|______|-------*x largest
                    q1      q2     q3
      
left skewed = ____/|_
